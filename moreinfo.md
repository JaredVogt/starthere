### Additional public file locations
* [Dropbox](http://db.install.coffee) (for example, Keyboard Maestro macros)

### Some additional articles (these need to be written)

* Legacy Repos - [kickit](https://github.com/JaredVogt/kickit), [.config](https://github.com/JaredVogt/.config)
* how I use dropbox
* my policy on backups and how they are done
* 


### Additional notes

All apps on my machine are loaded 5 different ways
* mas (GUI apps) - if an app has both a store and a cask, will default to the store version first (this will ask me to login?)
* brew (CLI apps)
* brew cask (GUI apps)
* custom script to download zips (downloaded to `~/Desktop/toinstall`) (GUI apps)
* cloning of repos executed in a script in dotfiles (needs to be defined) (in general these will be CLI)
