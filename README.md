# starthere
Start here to get oriented with all repos and technical things. I am using github as my starting point to setup machines, keep track of external datasources. Access this directly at [fancy url](https://place.test.com).

Here are relevant repos
* [bitbar extensions](https://github.com/JaredVogt/bitbar)
* [my .vimrc and vim related stuff](https://github.com/JaredVogt/vimrc)
* [this is where to start when setting up a new machine](https://github.com/JaredVogt/kickit)
* [historical repo with tons of configuration stuff in it](https://github.com/JaredVogt/.config)


### Security
To get all security stuff up and happy need to create a .gitconfig and also setup keys in .ssh? That previous sentance needs to be verified - details need to be figured out.
