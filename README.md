# starthere
Start here to get oriented with all repos and technical things. I am using github as my starting point to setup machines, keep track of external datasources. 

Here are relevant repos
* [bitbar extensions](https://github.com/JaredVogt/bitbar)
* [my .vimrc and vim related stuff](https://github.com/JaredVogt/vimrc)
* [this is where to start when setting up a new machine](https://github.com/JaredVogt/kickit)
* [historical repo with tons of configuration stuff in it](https://github.com/JaredVogt/.config)
